# libtables2
This framework allows for rapid development of dynamic, interactive web-
applications that leverage the power of a relational database backend. It is
aimed at developers with a firm grasp of SQL who wish to minimize the time
spent on writing the PHP and Javascript plumbing for their web-application. Its
features include:
* Live-updating tables
* Paginated, sortable and filterable tables
* Inline editing of table-cells (edit-in-place)
* Validated input forms inserting into multiple tables at once with foreign keys
* Pulldown-menus based on 1-to-many relationships with option to add entries
* Cell tooltips based on hidden columns
* Custom table layouts

All client-server interaction is AJAX-based, so libtables2 is suitable to use
in single-page, load-once web-applications.
